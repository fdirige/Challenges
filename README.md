# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

This challenge was about replacing div tags with better semantic elements. I've replaced div tags with `<header>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` tags in my code. Additionally, I've fixed a bug in the code where the Search Engine Optimization header link was not functioniong properly.
